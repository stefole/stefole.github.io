(For example DPOD3_HUMAN and DPOD4_HUMAN)\n\nYes, it does as some of these proteins are subunits of complexes that do bind DNA.\n“Catalytic vs accessory subunits:\n\nPOLD1 (DPOD1_HUMAN) is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ, with DNA polymerase and exonuclease domains — it binds DNA directly.\nPOLD2, POLD3, POLD4 are accessory subunits. They don’t themselves have DNA-binding motifs but they stabilize the catalytic subunit, anchor PCNA, or mediate interactions with other replication/repair factors.”\n\nEach edge in the Pol δ network represents a protein-protein interaction determined experimentally. A number of different pieces of information could potentially be associated with each interaction:\n\nExperimental method used.\nWhether the interaction is stable or transient.\nHow much experimental support is there for the interactions (e.g. a single experiment, 3 experiments or 100+ experiments).\n\n\nYou may consider the following interpretation of the score:\n\n0.0 - 0.3 : poor experimental support\n0.3 - 0.9 : “good enough” experimental support\n0.9 - 1.0 : excellent experimental support\n\nTASK - import and visualize network\n\nMake an igraph object with the interactions, edge attributes, and node attributes\nVisualize the network with ggraph, adding some formatting of the edges continuously by the confidence score (color, width, or transparency are good options)\nMake a discrete vector based on the three categories above, and add reload the igraph object. Make three different colors, widths, line types, or whatever else you can come up with to make a visually pleasing and informative visualization.\n\n\nggraph(e, layout = \"kk\") +\n    geom_edge_link(\n        aes(\n            edge_colour = confidence,\n            edge_alpha = confidence,\n            edge_width = confidence\n        )\n    ) +\n    scale_edge_colour_gradientn(\n        colours = c(\"plum1\", \"mediumpurple3\", \"purple4\"),\n        values  = c(0, 0.3, 0.9, 1),\n        name    = \"Confidence\" # name for the edge colorbar\n    ) +\n    guides(edge_colour = guide_edge_colourbar(\n        title  = \"Confidence\",\n        ticks  = TRUE,\n        breaks = c(0.15, 0.6, 0.95),\n        labels = c(\"0.0–0.3 poor\", \"0.3–0.9 good\", \"0.9–1.0 excellent\")\n    )) +\n    scale_edge_alpha(range = c(0.2, 1)) +\n    scale_edge_width(range = c(0.3, 1.5)) +\n\n    # NODES\n    geom_node_point(aes(colour = Role_in_replication, shape = DNA_Binding), size = 6) +\n    geom_node_label(aes(label = GeneID), repel = TRUE, box.padding = 0.4) +\n    scale_colour_manual(values = c(\n        \"Polymerase\" = \"steelblue\",\n        \"Primase\"    = \"forestgreen\",\n        \"Helicase\"   = \"orange\",\n        \"DNA repair\" = \"purple\",\n        \"Uncertain\"  = \"gray40\"\n    ), na.translate = FALSE) +\n    scale_shape_manual(values = c(\"+\" = 16, \"-\" = 15), na.translate = FALSE) +\n    theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich do you prefer - continuous or discrete visualization of line colors? I prefer continuous\nFINAL QUESTION - Re-evaluate the three “uncertain” proteins (BACD1_HUMAN, PDIP2_HUMAN, S7A6O_HUMAN):\nConsider the following points and make a conclusion based on the combined evidence on which of the three proteins are likely to be true interaction partners:\n\nThe proteins they are interacting with.\nThe experimental support for the interactions.\nAny biological information (any hints, basically) you may have picked up from skimming through the UniProt pages for each of the three proteins.\n\nBased on the experimental evidence, BACD1_HUMAN, PDIP2_HUMAN are true interaction partners. They both also interact with DPOD2_HUMAN, which is clearly involved. BACD1_HUMAN seems to be a co-factor for DPOD2_HUMAN. But S7A6O_HUMAN does not seem to be involved as the experimental support is very weak."
